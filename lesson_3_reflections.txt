When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other developers or simply to back up my work remotely. 
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I think that could overwite changes you've made locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

   Fork essentially takes another user's repositrory and creates a new and separate thread on my own account. Clone copies another user's repository to my local machine. Branch differs from Fork in that the copied repository is still considered part of the original project and may be re-merged with the original master branch at a later time.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In case you are going offline for a while and still want to have access to the repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Google docs would be harder to find conflicts, merge branches, and revert to differenct versions from different people,  but the interface is initially more intuitive. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
